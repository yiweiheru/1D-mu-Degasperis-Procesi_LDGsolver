** Simulate the shock-peakon solution of gDP successfully!!!

   It is result my mistake of taking wrong exact solution cause of the wrong understanding to g''(x). 
   It should be taken to 1 instead of 0 on the peakon points in the whole domain [0,1).
** TODO Search for the smooth exact solution for gDP to compute the accuracy list.
   SCHEDULED: <2018-01-10 Wed 03:00>
** Read the article [On the Cauchy problem for a weakly dissipative muDP equation]
*** TODO Figure out the blow up phenomena for gDP equation.
** discution with Xu.
** Profile time
